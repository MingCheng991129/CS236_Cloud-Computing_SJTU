This folder contains the final report of this class. 

I studied 10 recent papers about **distributed machine learning** and talked about my understanding in this report.

Also, I found a new problem in this area (problems about data preprocessing) and proposed a method to solve it inspired by neural networks.

The whole report is written in the format of IEEE Transaction.
