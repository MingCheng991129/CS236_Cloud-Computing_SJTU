This folder contains the experiment of this class, including the code as well as the result.

In the first part of this experiment, I use *Pregel* to implement SSSP and use *GraphLoader.edgeListFile* to do the preprocessing
of the data.

In the second part of this experiment, I use *PageRank (aggregateMessages)* to select the ID of top20 candidates in the given dataset.
As for this part, the result is shown in *result.txt*.

The code of the experiment can be seen in *spark.scala*.

The environment required:
- Hadoop
- Spark
